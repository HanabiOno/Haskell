# Haskell Assignment

[Assignment 7] (https://advprog.auc-computing.nl/assignment7.html) for Advanced Programming




###Functions
All functions can be found in the file Functions.hs.

> Haskell already has definitions for some of these functions, e.g. map, so to avoid a name collision the functions are named functions map', etc.

###Unit tests
Unit tests for the functions can be found in FunctionsSpec.hs.


>In order to test the functions please install the needed packages by giving the following commands:
    $ cabal install hspec --lib
    $ cabal install QuickCheck --lib

>After Installing the packages you can run the unit tests by giving the following command:
    $ runhaskell FunctionsSpec.hs
